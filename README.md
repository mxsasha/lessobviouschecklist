# The Less Obvious Conference Checklist

This is a checklist for conference organisers of less obvious things. It’s easy will remember to book a venue, look for speakers and sell the tickets, but you could overlook many small things that can help your conference stand out. I mainly compiled this list from my own experience and from what I’ve seen other conferences do. So although I compiled the list, many recommendations are the result of hard work of others. See the AUTHORS file for a more extensive attribution.

This is not a checklist of things you must do in order for your conference to be any good. Or a list of requirements for me to do something for your conference. Consider this more as a list of actionable and practical suggestions to help us make better conferences.

### Something is missing / I disagree

This list is almost certainly incomplete. If you have any suggestions, open a pull request. And if we can’t come to agreement, you can always start a fork :)

## Inclusivity and accessibility

- The importance of inclusivity is becoming well known in most communities. In general, remember that inclusivity is not exclusively about gender.
- Have a code of conduct / inclusivity policy. There are [plenty](http://www.djangounderthehood.com/coc/) of [examples](https://us.pycon.org/2015/about/code-of-conduct/) for this. Most of them can be summarised as “don’t be an asshole, and be considerate for how your actions may be perceived by others” but for numerous reasons that have been discussed at length elsewhere, it is important to include more detail.
- Write an accessibility statement. I wrote one for [Django Under the Hood](http://www.djangounderthehood.com/accessibility/). In this statement, you inform people with physical, visual or auditory impairments what you can offer them. This doesn’t mean your conference must be accessible, and if it’s unavoidable it’s ok to say you don’t know. It’s most important role is that you inform people what you are planning to do, what you do and don’t know, and that you’re happy to listen to anyone’s questions in this area.
- For people with physical impairments, be specific about the actual situation. Some people that use wheelchairs can actually cross a few steps if needed. Some require specific accessible toilets, others do not. A generic term like “wheelchair accessible” leaves many questions for these people.
- For people with auditory impairments, consider having a captioner/stenographer. This can also be incredibly helpful for non-native speakers, and means you have a written and searchable record afterwards. This was done at !!Con, who [wrote about how well it worked out for them](http://composition.al/blog/2014/05/31/your-next-conference-should-have-real-time-captioning/).
- If you are providing food, ask people in advance (during ticket registration, for example) about any preferences / allergies. This doesn’t mean you must cater to every possible option, but often a lot is possible.
- Consider offering childcare, to make the event more accessible to parents. [PyCon](http://us.pycon.org/2015/childcare/) has done this in the past. You could poll whether attendees might be interested, and see if it would be affordable for the parents. Perhaps one of the parents would even be happy to volunteer to help with preparation work. There can be legal requirements involved.
- For events involving alcohol, help people who do not drink feel welcome. Mention non-alcoholic drinks as often as alcoholic drinks, make them equally visible and have an equal number of options. Non-drinkers should not have to justify themselves. [This article](https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/alcohol-and-inclusivity-planning-tech-events-with-non-alcoholic-options) has many more great practical tips.
- Some ways to improve inclusivity may seem odd or useless to you as organisers. However, they can often make a big difference for other attendees in different positions and from different backgrounds, at little cost to you.


## Making attendees feel at home

- In general, use all your communication to make attendees feel welcome. At Django Under The Hood, we had posters with “Yay, you made it!” on all the entrances. Even minor touches like that can help create a good atmosphere at your conference.
- The city where you’re holding your conference is probably well known to you. This is not the case for most of your visitors. Make them feel at home.
- Help your attendees find their way around by writing something about travelling to and around the conference. [Here’s what I wrote for Django Under the Hood](http://www.djangounderthehood.com/travel/). Which airport should people go to? How do they best get to the city? How do they get from hotels to the venue? Can I buy transit tickets with a credit card? Do I need a visa? Is there a nearby supermarket?
- Help attendees stay near other attendees. As soon as you know, tell people what the speaker hotel will be, so that others can decide to book there as well. Publish a few recommendations of alternatives, ideally with varying budgets.
- In your program, be clear on what food you’re providing. Some conferences offer breakfast at the venue and then forget to tell attendees, which will then already have paid for hotel breakfast. The other way around also happens.
- Don’t publish attendees’ info on an attendee list or something similar, without them opting in.
- Make sure the organisers are visible. If you have a registration desk, try to have someone there all the time. If an attendee needs help, it can make them feel very lost if they can’t find an organiser.


## Speakers

- Be clear on what’s in your speaker package as soon as you open the call for papers. Personally, I rarely speak at events where travel and stay are not covered by the conference, but others may make other decisions. But they can only do so if you inform them.
- If you are doing a call for papers, also send it to minority groups in your subject. If it’s a Python conference, contact your local and the global PyLadies chapter, and ask whether they can recommend any other minority groups whose participants may be interested in submitting a proposal. Have your code of conduct up on the website before sending out your call for papers.
- Conferences and communities benefit from having a good mix of experienced well known speakers, and less experienced speakers. For the latter, it can be helpful to offer some basic coaching, if only by looking over their slides, to help improve their sessions and their confidence. Perhaps there are open speaker coaching groups in their hometown that can help them, like [Appsterdam’s monthly speaker training meeting](http://www.meetup.com/Appsterdam/events/215689012/). Perhaps some of your more experiences speakers can help out. If you’re willing to help with this include it in your call for papers, so less experienced speakers feel welcome, confident and supported.
- Ensure that all your speakers are familiar with your code of conduct.
- Ensure you get the details of the sessions right. A good way to do this is to mail all speakers a week in advance (or at least before any print material is produced) confirming the times, locations, titles and abstracts of their sessions. Also useful to include: when you expect them to be at the venue at the latest, whether they should report anywhere specific, the details of their flight and hotel if applicable, and what technology you have available (beamer, adapters, connectors, etc.).
- Remember to get all your speakers a modest speaker gift at the conference, regardless of the size of the speaker package.


## Ticket sales

- If you have a limited amount of tickets and expect to sell out quickly, limit the number of tickets per purchase. That’ll give everyone a fair chance, and help get a mixed group of attendees, instead of a small number of companies buying out all the tickets.
- When deciding when to open ticket sales, consider different time zones. 11:00 in Europe means Americans would have to wake up in the night to get tickets. 15:00 UTC often works fairly well for Europe and America, but not as good for Asia.
- If you think you might sell out, set up a waiting list. You could send any cancelled tickets here, and refund the person that needed to cancel. At Django Under the Hood, we re-sold three tickets the day before the conference, making six people happy.
- Don’t sell all your tickets right away. Keep a small batch (5 or so) for unforeseen situations. You can always decide to sell them as last-minute tickets later.
- If you have any side events, like a sprint, ask people in the ticket whether they will attend. That’ll get you some attendance numbers early on. Make sure people who are not familiar with sprints or another event can easily find what they are about.
- Giving out t-shirts or other clothes? Ask people for their size when registering, and use this list at the registration desk when handing out the shirts. It speeds things up and helps make your t-shirt order more accurate.
- Under absolutely [no circumstances](http://conferencesburnedbypaypal.tumblr.com) use [PayPal](http://pydanny.com/we-are-not-using-paypal.html) for receiving payments. In general, be careful with who you give control over your funds. Get it to your own bank account as soon as possible.


## Team

- Try hard to avoid running a conference on your own. It’s a lot of work, and you need to have other people around that can relieve you of some tasks if it’s really needed, and help to find the inspiration you'll need.
- Make sure to have some silent way of communicating across the entire team, that offers push messages too. A whatsapp group, for example. There will be unforeseen issues, and being able to communicate within the team is essential.
- If you have volunteers outside of the main team that help you with registration, goodie bag sorting, or anything else, don’t forget to thank them for their work. Even a private word of appreciation can make a difference.


## Other

- If you are making recordings, make sure you have at least have a dedicated person for this, but ideally hire a professional. For photos and videos, make sure you carefully review the contract regarding intellectual property: by default the laws in many countries leave all rights with the creator you hired, even though you pay them.
- If you are making badges, make sure the names are very visible. About half the conferences I visit print the names no larger than 14pt or so, which makes them impossible to read from any distance. Ideally, print them double sided as they tend to flip around.
- Always make a few extra blank badges, so that you can make some on the spot if needed, for example because you misprinted a badge.
- Don’t forget to have fun :)
