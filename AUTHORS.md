# Authors

This list is originally compiled by @mxsasha, based on experiences from attending many conferences, and co-organising Django Under the Hood in 2014 together the stellar @bmispelon, @olasitarska and @mjtamlyn. Over time, this list was expanded.

Some conferences that inspired items on this list are various editions of DjangoCon Europe, Write the Docs, PyCon UK, DevOpsDays London, SIGNAL London and many others.

In other words, although I did compile this list, most of the recommendations would not exist without the hard work of many others.

Note that the conferences and people mentioned do not necessarily endorse this list.
