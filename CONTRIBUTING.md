## Contributions and credit policy

I welcome good faith contributions to this checklist.
However, it is intentionally highly opiniated to my views.
That means I may refuse contributions for no other reason than that do not align with my opinion on conferences.
I also try to balance level of detail and thoroughness, while avoiding an excessively long list.
Sometimes references to third party sources are more fitting.
If you're not sure whether your ideas would be welcomed, please discuss them in a GitHub issue first.

I also welcome edits to improve clarity, grammar, or spelling.
I discourage non-trivial contributions made through automation, such as using an LLM to rewrite prose.
Try to keep your pull requests a reasonable size, for example do not mix a general style change with adding new items to the list.

To contribute changes to the checklist, create a pull request against the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mxsasha/lessobviouschecklist) and include an edit to add your name to the [AUTHORS](https://github.com/mxsasha/lessobviouschecklist/blob/main/AUTHORS.md) file in your pull request.
If you contribute in ways other than changing the list, please also create a pull request to add yourself to the AUTHORS file.
If you don't know how to make a pull request, please contact me.
Adding yourself to the AUTHORS file is optional, you may choose to omit this.

I aim to review and act on all pull requests within one month of their submission.
If I do not, please contact me.
If I decide to edit your contribution, I will check it in with your name as the primary author, and me as a secondary author.
If the contribution is a collaborative effort, all collaborators can be included in the AUTHORS file and included as additional authors in the commit.

If you notice that credit has been recorded incorrectly, please contact me.
I aim to respond within one month.

Your credits and/or your contributions may be removed or rejected if you violate this project's Code of Conduct.

This policy also applies to itself.

### Naming convention

Names for credit are whatever name the person being credited prefers.
I accept any UTF-8 string of reasonable length as a name.
If a person's name has changed, please create a pull request editing the credits section of this document together with the git .mailmap file (if applicable). 
Ireserve the right to reject names that appear to be chosen with some goal other than identifying the contributor.

## Credits

This policy was constructed using the [contributions and credits policy guide](https://github.com/contribution-credit/policy) created by members of the RIPE Open Source Working Group. For a full list of contributors to that guide, see https://github.com/contribution-credit/policy/blob/main/CREDITS.md
